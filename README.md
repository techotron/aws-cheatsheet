# sre-resources
A place for revising SRE things.

## Context
This is an app I've devised to help me with learning application architecture as well as a way keep engaged with revising for an AWS certification.

Once complete, it will hopefully also serve as a point of reference for things which are relevent to the SRE profession

## Linting
This is performed by GH Actions on a merge to master. To test this locally, run `make lint` from the root directory.
