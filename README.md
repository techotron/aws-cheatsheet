# aws-tutor
A place for revising AWS things.

TODO: 
- [x] rename aws-tutor to aws-tutor
- [x] create parent routes for adding different sections eg `/revision` and `/scenarios`
- [ ] load different NavBar, depending on the section (may need to change App to class and use state)
- [ ] Connect Node API to database to serve content
- [ ] Display content on frontend which has been fetched from the DB by the backend
- [ ] Create mechanism to updating database ([db-migrate](https://db-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting%20Started/installation/#new-instructions-since-v010x))
- [ ] Add data from mock services to database using above method
- [ ] Create services in backend to return data
- [ ] Replace mock services with backend services
